# Rapp Canary 365
Lightweight solution for Microsoft Dynamics 365 with a Canary plugin that traces events

Import the [solution](https://github.com/rappen/RappCanary365/tree/master/Solution) to get all kinds of events in the system written to the Plugin Trace Log. Add more steps, add images, add anything using Plugin Registration Tool, or disable existing steps to reduce the chatterness of the canary.

Use Plugin Trace Viewer for XrmToolBox to view the results.

The [canary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine) can be used to get insights into events occuring in the system, and may help finding gas leaks or other dangerous things in your Micsrosoft Dynamics 365 system.
